Tutorial (Day 1):

Captain: Good morning, comrade! 
Player: ...
Captain: You were chosen for this job because your valuable skills can help serve the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
Player: ... 
Captain: Before we start, you need to swear to always protect the interests of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
Player: ... 
Captain: You heard me, comrade?
Player: ... I promise to maintain official secrecy and under no circumstances will I mention anything in front of the authorities, courts or family members. I am ready to use all my abilities to protect the people and will always fight against the enemies of our socialist homeland. I will strictly protect state secrets. I will use all my strengths and abilities. I am ready to put my life on the line in the fight for the interests of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and in fulfilling its international obligations in the fight for the victory of peace and communism. So I swear.
Captain: See, comrade, this is how we can work together. Now listen carefully and don't waste my time. 
Captain: Every morning, you will receive instructions in the mail. Remember that it is strictly classified information. You must operate the radio and move the troops according to the instructions. Your job is to protect the state. Any illegal movement between the borders must be reported immediately. Do you understand?
Player: Yes, Captain. 
Captain: Good. Sometimes, you might need to solve other problems, but I will leave that for another day. Now, focus on this: after you receive a message from the radio, you have to take the map and move the troops between sectors to defend the borders. 
Captain: Remember that all your actions have consequences.

Letter - Family 
Hello dear Peter, 
How have you been? And your wife? I am happy for you. I heard you have a good job and a place to live. It seems like they take good care of you. I always knew you would do great things with your talents and skills. Ever since you were a kid, you were an extraordinary one. Always a good student, exemplary son, a good friend, hard-working person... and kind... You have always been nothing but kind to our family. When I was a kid, my father would get drunk, and you stood up to him. I will never forget that. It was one of the bravest and kindest things someone has ever done for me. 
My father, he died recently. I didn't want to attend the funeral, but I did, and I kept remembering the life we had as kids, and it made me think of you. 
I never had to ask for your help because you always helped us without expecting anything. But I am asking now. Please forgive me for asking you for help. It is the only time I am asking you, and I promise you that. I promise we will never bother you again. 
My husband hasn't been doing great. Ever since the accident with the Soviets, he hasn't really recovered. It's been very difficult. Every day is a fight for life. I try to stay hopeful and believe it will improve, but when? And hope? And how does that help us right now? Hope will not feed us and pay for us.  
Peter, please, help us leave. Please be kind to us one more time, and help save two lives. And maybe more. 
We're ready if you can help us tomorrow at 12:45. 
With love, 
Your friend Elena.

Emil H., member of the National Theatre: I don't have any opinion. Maybe in the future, this will be funny. But right now? Tragedy. 
Jan P., professor: I am surprised. I don't think anyone expected this. 
MUDr. Anton B.: Today at our surgery department, when we heard what happened, everyone stood up and cried. Many of our patients left and went home unless the treatment was necessary. My personal opinion? Occupation is not the way to solve problems between countries. 


Do not provoke the occupants. Stay at work, stay active, show support in legal ways, and continue working!

Endings:
1. Congratulations, you showed yourself to be an exemplary Soviet citizen. You will continue in your work. Glory to the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. 

2. You have been arrested, and you will be sent into the forced labor camp. You betrayed your own people, family, country, and homeland. 

3. The Soviets decided to remove the troops after negotiations, but with a warning. Next time, any attempts to deviate from socialism may have far more severe consequences. 

4. 1989 - The demonstration on 17 November 1989 led to the events known as the Velvet Revolution. It marked a fundamental democratization turn in Czechoslovakia. 

5. 1989 - The Romanian Revolution 
The violent civil unrest led to the execution of the longtime Romanian Communist Party. It was also the last removal of a Marxist–Leninist government in a Warsaw Pact country during the events of 1989 and the only one that violently overthrew a country's leadership and executed its leader; according to estimates, over one thousand people died, and thousands more were injured.

6. The revolution was successful, and after a series of events and protests, the Soviet Union dissolved.
